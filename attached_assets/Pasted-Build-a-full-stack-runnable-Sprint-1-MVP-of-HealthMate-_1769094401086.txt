Build a full-stack, runnable **Sprint 1 (MVP)** of *HealthMate — Appointment Scheduler* as a single Repl. Produce real, editable source code (not a prototype screenshot). Use React for frontend and Node.js + Express for backend. Prioritize clarity, modularity, and tests. Where production-grade choices conflict with Replit free environment, choose options that run immediately on a free Repl but include a simple switch to PostgreSQL.

Requirements — Sprint 1 (MVP)
1. Patient flows:
   - Registration (email + password), login, profile page, view appointments.
   - JWT-based authentication; secure password hashing (bcrypt).
2. Doctor flows:
   - Doctor registration/login, profile listing, search by specialty.
   - Doctor dashboard showing today's schedule + upcoming appointments.
   - Manage availability: set working hours and create time slots.
3. Booking:
   - Patients can view doctor availability and book an appointment.
   - Prevent double bookings (server-side check + DB constraint).
   - Cancel & reschedule (basic flow).
4. Data:
   - Default: **SQLite** for immediate Replit use.
   - Provide clear instructions and config to swap to **PostgreSQL** (same migrations).
5. API:
   - REST endpoints with OpenAPI-style API.md file.
   - Implement server-side validation and clear error messages.
6. Frontend:
   - Responsive UI (Tailwind CSS).
   - Pages: Home, Login, Register, Patient Dashboard, Doctor Listing, Booking page, Doctor Dashboard.
7. Testing:
   - Unit tests for booking conflict detection (backend) using Jest.
8. Dev DX:
   - README with run instructions and sample env file `.env.example`.
   - Seed script to create sample doctors, patients, and available slots.
   - `npm run dev` for backend, `npm start` for frontend (or one start script that runs both via concurrently).
9. Quality:
   - Add comments, use ESLint config, and basic CI config (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) to run tests.
   - Keep code modular: controllers, services, models, routes, utils.
10. Deliverables (what the Agent must produce):
   - `frontend/` React app (create-react-app or Vite) with components and API service layer.
   - `backend/` Express app with routes, controllers, models (use Prisma or Sequelize with SQLite config), migrations, and tests.
   - `README.md`, `API.md`, `DATABASE.md`, `.env.example`, `seed.js`.
   - Simple Dockerfile (optional) and instructions to deploy to Render/Heroku.
   - Acceptance tests / sample curl commands in README.

Implementation details & constraints
- Authentication: JWT stored in Authorization header. Refresh tokens are optional — include explanation in README.
- DB layer: Use **Prisma** (recommended) or Sequelize. Configure `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. Provide Prisma schema and `prisma migrate dev` instructions. If using Sequelize, provide SQL migrations.
- Double-book prevention:
  - Add DB unique constraint on `(doctor_id, slot_start)` (or equivalent).
  - In booking service: wrap check+create in a transaction and return 409 on conflict.
- Slots: Doctors create availability as date + start_time + end_time + slot_duration (e.g., 30m) → system generates bookable slots.
- Timezone: store all timestamps in UTC and show local time on frontend. Include note to user to set timezone in profile.
- Email/SMS: stubbed out services (e.g., `notifications/sendEmail()` and `notifications/sendSMS()` that log to console). Add comments where to plug SendGrid/Twilio.
- Seed: create 3 doctors with specialties and availability for the next 7 days; create 3 demo patients.

Run instructions for Replit (add to README)
- Single-Repl run: root `package.json` with `start` to run both apps (use concurrently).
- Environment: copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
- To try PostgreSQL locally: show `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/healthmate` and migration steps.
- Provide quick test curl commands (login, list doctors, book appointment).

Acceptance criteria (automated & manual)
- Backend unit test: booking service must have a test proving two concurrent booking attempts for same slot result in one success + one conflict (409).
- Manual smoke tests: register user, login, view doctors, book slot, see appointment in doctor dashboard, cancel appointment.
- README includes required sample data and expected endpoints.

Developer notes for the Agent (how to output files)
- Create files exactly as needed: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `README.md`, `API.md`, `.env.example`.
- Do not output any large inline data in the response; instead write real files in the project.
- Ensure `npm install` and `npm run dev` commands are working out-of-the-box on a fresh Repl.
- Keep code simple and well-documented — prefer clarity over cleverness.

Extra helpful things to include (bonus)
- Small Cypress or Playwright smoke test (optional).
- Simple analytics stub for Sprint 2 readiness.
- TODOs labeled `SPRINT2:` in code where to plug SendGrid/Twilio/Analytics.

User stories mapping (Sprint 1) — ensure each is implemented:
- Patient register/login/profile — implemented
- Patient view doctors w/ specialties/availability — implemented
- Patient book appointment — implemented + conflict prevention
- Cancel & reschedule — implemented basic
- Doctor register/login, dashboard, set working hours & slots — implemented
- View patient history (simple appointments list) — implemented
- Mark appointment completed/no-show/reschedule — implemented basic

Finally, after finishing the initial build:
1. Add a short `how to test` message at the top of README for the instructor.
2. Provide a single command to run backend tests (e.g., `cd backend && npm test`).
3. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` with initial generation details.

If anything is unclear, assume the simplest reasonable option that runs on Replit free (SQLite + Prisma). Prioritize a complete, working Sprint 1 over extra bells & whistles.

End of prompt.
